# Running Code (Part B)

In this stage, you will run the code, by using the provided data. The `REPLICATION.md`  is the report!

## Principles

Keep a log of what you do, what you find, and what does not work, in the `REPLICATION.md`, under *Findings*.

You should also run code so that it generates an actual "log file". How to do this depends on the software. We have an [entire section of the manual](running-code-general) for this!

Once you have run the code, come back here to continue!

## Details

- If code runs for a long time, record in the Jira issue (as a comment) when you started the code. 
- Use the `Computing Environment` to record where (CCSS, BioHPC node, etc.) you started the code.
- It is not unusual for code to run for several days. You can start a new case in the meantime!
