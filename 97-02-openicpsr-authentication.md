# openICPSR Authentication

## First-time 

Go to [https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/) and in the top-right corner, choose `Login/Create an account`. You will be redirected to the ICPSR account web page.

- You should create an account with your `netid@cornell.edu`
- You can link your account with your Netid via Google student authentication BUT:
- You must still create a separate password for use by the [automation scripts](setup-bash).

## Creating an openICPSR-specific password when you linked your accounts

Go to [https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/). If you are logged in (top-right corner shows your name), log out.

- If you already have a **linked** account, request a new password

- Choose a password that is **NOT** the same as your Cornell NetID password!
