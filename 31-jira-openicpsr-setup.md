# Basic setup

In the JMS, the Data Editor is set up as a reviewer who can be assigned during the conditional accept stage. Assignment is via email to a pre-configured email address. Once the Data Editor has finalized the replication report, a manual upload is required to submit the report. If the report requires a revision, a note may need to be posted on the openICPSR deposit as well. If the report requires no revisions, a note is made on the openICPSR deposit to confirm that everything is in order.
