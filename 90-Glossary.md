## Terms

- **Jira ticket number** - The main way to refer to your cases. If you need help, this number is necessary for us to know
- **MC Number** - (or Manuscript Central Number) This is how we identify the manuscript. Only necessary to know for the replication report header
- **open ICPSR** - The repository that holds the data and code that the author has submitted. This will eventually be published.
- **[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/aeaverification/workspace/overview/)** - The repository that holds the replication report, code-check.xlsx, and any other items necessary to write the report. You will add the code from open ICPSR via [Pipeline or manually](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/ldilab-manual/11-01-workflow-in-progress.html#ingesting-author-materials). This repository is private. Authors will only see the replication report.

- **environments** - where you will be running the code
    - **CISER/CCSS**
        - Cloud

- **RR**
- **CA**
- **Revision** - A [Revision](https://labordynamicsinstitute.github.io/ldilab-manual/12-jira-revision-guidance.html) is the second time we see a case. A bitbucket repository already exists for this case.
