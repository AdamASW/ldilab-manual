# Adding the article DOI to the openICPSR deposit metadata

- Choose the space "related publications"

[screenshot here]

- (optional) remove the existing manually added temporary link (usually with date "n.d.")
- obtain the article's DOI
- use the "Import from DOI" functionality
- Verify that all information seems correct.
- Save.

It is not necessary to publish the deposit again, this metadata takes effect immediately.

```{note}
Authors can also do this themselves. In the case of PSID or related repositories, this action **must** be performed by authors themselves.
