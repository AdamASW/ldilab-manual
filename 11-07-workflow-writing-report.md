# Writing Report

At this stage, you will write the final version of the report.

- There is sample language for commonly encountered problems at the [Fragments for REPLICATION.md](`r config$url$templmd`sample-language-report.md) link in the tall grey bar
- Clean up the REPLICATION.md - it should be factual, objective, and not written in the first person.
- Copy-and-paste the *code-check.xlsx*, including the column "Replicated?" and any notes column, into the "Findings" part. Use the [Excel-to-Markdown plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=csholmq.excel-to-markdown-table) for VSCode. 
- Delete all of the instructional lines in REPLICATION.md  before finishing the report.
- When there are differences: Include images of figures and screenshots of tables (both paper and as-reproduced) in the report
- Highlight differences:
    - if only a small number of table entries: mention them by table in the report
    - if a larger number: Highlight on the reproduced images (of figures, screenshots of tables) the differences you have observed
- Check that the `DataCitationSummary` field is filled out indicating how many data citations are in order: all, some, or none. 

To complete this stage, enter the direct URL of the report, i.e., in the relevant repository (if not already pre-filled):
