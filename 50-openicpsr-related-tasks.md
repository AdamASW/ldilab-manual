:::{note}
The AEA uses openICPSR  as its data and code repository.

In addition to the various tasks already described on openICPSR (here, [here](using-pre-pub-openicpsr), and [here](submitting-info-via-openicpsr)), some other tasks may sometimes need to be done on the platform. This section describes those tasks.
