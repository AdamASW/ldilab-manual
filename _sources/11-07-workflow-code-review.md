# Code Review

In this stage, you are verifying the code by inspecting the completeness of the source code. In general, your ability to detect any issues is limited, but go through the code one more time, and identify 

- packages that are installed late in the code, but not mentioned in a setup program or the README
- commands that your experience shows require packages to be installed, but are not mentioned.

Note that in this stage, "Working location of data" and "Computing environment" section in the report are not relevant, so write N/A for these sections.

The `REPLICATION.md is the report!
