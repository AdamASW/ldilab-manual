# openICPSR Authentication

## First-time 

Go to [https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/) and in the top-right corner, choose `Login/Create an account`. You will be redirected to the ICPSR account web page.

- You should create an account with your `netid@cornell.edu`
- You can link your account with your Netid via Google student authentication BUT:
- You must still create a separate password for use by the [automation scripts](setup-bash).

## Creating an openICPSR-specific password when you linked your accounts

- Go to [https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/). 
- If you are logged in (top-right corner shows your name), log out, or open the page in a different browser.
- On the login page, choose the "Sign in with email" option.

- Use the **same** email you used to create your account (i.e., `netid@cornell.edu`), but choose the "Forgot password" link

- Choose a password that is **NOT** the same as your Cornell NetID password! 

- Now go to the [Bash setup](setup-bash) instructions, and change your password.
