# AEA: Reviewing and (Pre-) Approving Reports

"Approvers" and "Pre-approvers" will review the reports, and finalize the Summary. 

## Generic Guidance

- Pre-approvals usually can be completed rather quickly and should be prioritized.
- The pre-approver should not be running any of the code or downloading any of the data unless asked to do so.
- The language for the `[REQUIRED]` tag comments is drawn from the [Sample Language for Reports](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/sample-language-report.md). To ensure uniformity across reports, pre-approvers are encouraged to use the phrases verbatim.

## Preliminary Steps for Pre-approving Reports

:::{admonition} The "Review for pre-approval" transition in Jira requires specific permissions. 

If you have not been granted this permission, please reach out to your supervisor. 

:::

1. Clone the Bitbucket repository of the report that requires pre-approval to the local machine or CISER machine. **Do not download the openICPSR deposit!**  The pre-approver checks and finalizes the report but does not (usually) redo the whole replication.
  - You can also use "Github Codespaces" for this process.
2. Skim through the report and note if it is an original replication or a revision.  Follow the steps below correspondingly.
